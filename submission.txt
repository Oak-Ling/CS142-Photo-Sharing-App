Brief description to see the story in action:
story 2
In the user detail page, there is a new paper which lists all the photos that mention the
corresponding user. In the user photo page, when you try to add a new comment, there are
two input forms. The first one is for pure comment text and the second one is for the user to
mention someone who is also a registered user. The mention functionality will be triggered by '@'
and any other text will be ignored. If you @ someone which is not listed in the menu, that person
will also be ignored. After you mention someone, the mention list of the corresponding user will
be updated. Click on the thumbnail of the photo, user will be directed to the photo page. Click on
the photo owner's name, user will be directed to the user detail page of that owner.

story 7
Push the button labeled My Favorite on the toolbar and view complete favorite list of the
current user. Click on the thumbnail of the photo, a modal will pop up, you can view the
detail of photo by clicking on the Photo Detail button. Click on the delete icon will remove
the current photo from the favorite list. In the user's photo page, whenever you click on the
loving heart icon, it will become red. This photo will be added to the favorite list. If you
click the icon again, the heart will become grey. Current photo will be removed from the favorite
list.
special concern: I didn't disable the like button after the user favorite the photo because I
think there is no need for that. I hope this will not affect my points for this story.
